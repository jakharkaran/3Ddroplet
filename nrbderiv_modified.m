% 
% NRBDERIV: Construct the first and second derivative representation of a
%           NURBS curve, surface or volume.
% 
% Calling Sequence:
% 
%   ders = nrbderiv (nrb);
%   [ders, ders2] = nrbderiv (nrb);
% 
% INPUT:
% 
%   nrb		: NURBS data structure, see nrbmak.
%
% OUTPUT:
% 
%   ders:  A data structure that represents the first
% 		    derivatives of a NURBS curve, surface or volume.
%   ders2: A data structure that represents the second
% 		    derivatives of a NURBS curve, surface or volume.
% 
% Description:
% 
%   The derivatives of a B-Spline are themselves a B-Spline of lower degree,
%   giving an efficient means of evaluating multiple derivatives. However,
%   although the same approach can be applied to NURBS, the situation for
%   NURBS is more complex. We have followed in this function the same idea
%   that was already used for the first derivative in the function nrbderiv.
%   The second derivative data structure can be evaluated later with the
%   function nrbdeval.
